Given the resized data (64x64), this method builts a 
minibatch of images with square black holes in the center.
A list of corrupted images is returned in inputs, respective 
targets in a list named targets. 
Also, the list captions returns a set of captions for each
image.

For train = 1, images are from the training data;
for train = 0, images are from the validation data.

all = True if batch_size = data set length
In this case, batch_idx = 0
